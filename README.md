## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JS - to toggle navigation tab

### What I learned

I learned how to make a better layout that can be used to make a better responsive website. Added few concepts of Java Script (for the first time) to toggle between the navigation tab for the Mobile layout.

### Continued development

Currently I am focusing on learning more java script to help me make better websites. Especially, use of java script for entering data into the html files.
In this project I faced a lot of troble for placing the background and foreground images, so lookin forward to learn more about the image styling and positioning.
